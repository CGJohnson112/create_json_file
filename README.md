# create_json_file
imports JSON file from your PhpMyAdmin SQL database (database not included lol)

Okay, what this does is it takes a database table from your phpMyAdmin and dynamically converts that file to JSON.
The JSON file is located within this project.

Opening the URL will display the JSON data, and anytime the data is updated on the DB, you can refresh it, 
and it the JSON data will refresh your view and the file data in the .json file (in this case, 'ratings.json')
